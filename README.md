# Tome.gg Whitepaper

We're writing out what Tome.gg is all about.

[Read the latest version of the Whitepaper](./main.pdf).

## Objective

I am writing this Whitepaper to ensure I focus my efforts only on the most valuable aspects of my life's mission, my business, and my growth. I am writing out the [directions](https://sapalo.dev/2021/11/04/direction-strategy-tactics-and-execution/) for Tome.gg which is initially centered on coaching and mentoring services for mid- to senior-level software engineers.

## What does the Tome.gg Ecosystem look like?

You can also view the Tome.gg Ecosystem [here](./ecosystem.pdf) (this was built with Draw.io).

## Whitepaper Status

The Whitepaper is currently *a work in progress*, so expect `lorem ipsums` and improper formatting.
